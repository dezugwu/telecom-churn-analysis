# Model Limitations, Assumptions, and Ethics

## Phase 10: Responsible Use of Churn Prediction Models

### 10.1 Model Limitations
The churn prediction model is trained on historical data and assumes future customer behavior will follow similar patterns. As a result, it may not capture sudden market changes, competitor actions, or shifts in customer expectations.

Additionally, the model relies on available structured data and cannot account for unobserved factors such as customer sentiment or external economic conditions.

---

### 10.2 Data and Assumptions
The model assumes consistent data quality, stable service offerings, and relatively unchanged pricing structures. Over time, data drift or changes in customer behavior may reduce predictive accuracy.

Regular retraining and performance evaluation are required to maintain reliability.

---

### 10.3 Bias and Fairness Considerations
Certain demographic variables may correlate with churn outcomes, introducing potential bias if not carefully managed. The model should be used to offer retention support rather than restrict access, pricing, or service quality.

Fairness audits and responsible feature usage are essential to ethical deployment.

### 10.4 Mitigation and Governance
To ensure responsible use, the model should be monitored continuously, retrained periodically, and supported by human oversight. Clear documentation and governance processes help maintain transparency, fairness, and trust.
